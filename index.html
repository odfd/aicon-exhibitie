                            <p>AI is a rapidly evolving technology that only just recently is starting to impact society as a whole. This technology will change society as we know it. AICON aims to embrace this technology and make it conceptually accessible to all! To reach this goal AICON is designing <b>thought provoking art expositions</b> that are co-created using cutting edge AI technology with the inputs of inhabitants of Rotterdam, artists and scientists. </p>

                            <p>Art Installation consisting of different artworks that have been created and curated by the AIcon team in collaboration with Artificial Intelligence. The starting point and inspiration of the artworks are self-portraits made by a divers group of participants of our workshops we did throughout the city of Rotterdam during the year 2022. </p>
                            <p>Each art piece is based on interpretations of human creativity that we feed to the machine. The digital outcomes are then again translated in to (abstract) physical objects where the craft and tactility play a role.
The exhibition shows a circular co-creation process in between us and a new entity (AI) of which we are exploring its capabilities. The visitors of the exhibition (unknowingly) will also play a role as their feedback and commentary will be directly translated in to one of the artworks. This will be done by passive audio recording that will translate in real-time to images in an ever growing mosaic grid projected on one of the walls.  All captions, exhibitions texts, promotion materials, funding applications and press releases will be co-written by AI.</p>

                            <p>Visually demonstration of the behind the scenes process. The ‘artist’ studio, a room where the Artificial Intelligence is introduced as a co-creator of the art.  This consists in interactive displays of the audio recording process, from speech to text, processing the text, extracting keywords, prompt engineering, generating images/art, selecting from the generated images and ‘sending’ to the mosaic (the mosaic is projected in room 1).</p>
                            <p>Educational story diagrams (wall-sized posters) presented with an artistic style, about relevant AI topics, relevant to both the technology used in the exhibition, and relevant to the visitors. These diagrams will address thought provoking and sometimes controversial aspects of the selected topics, and shine light on the positive ways in which AI can be used to benefit each of us/the visitors as individuals, and society as a whole.
An optional feature would be an AI chatbot acting as if it is the artist and answers all your questions regarding the exhibition or the project in general.</p>
                            <p>Also the NFT’s made with the participants of the workshops can be presented here, photos/video of the workshops, Lucify implementation for the interactive diagrams or other augmented reality applications.</p>
